## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `src/lda/`: Source code of the Lindblad Dynamics Approximator.
- `notebooks/training_model.ipynb`: Shows how to train the model to learn the quantum dynamics from synthetic data.
- `notebooks/benchmark.ipynb`: Benchmarks the learned model against the exact dynamics to validate its performance.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the codebase.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment specification file.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

### üì¶ Using Conda (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giovannicemin/lindblad_dynamics_approximator.git
   cd lindblad_dynamics_approximator
   ```
   
2. **Create the environment**:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
   This will install all dependencies listed in the environment.yml file and make the lda package available for import and development.

3. **Activate the environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate lda
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

After installation, you can explore the notebooks:

- Open notebooks/training_model.ipynb to train the machine learning model from scratch.

- Use notebooks/benchmark.ipynb to evaluate how well the learned model approximates known quantum dynamics.
